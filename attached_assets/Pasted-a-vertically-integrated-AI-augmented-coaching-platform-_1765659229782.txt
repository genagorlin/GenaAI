a vertically integrated, AI‑augmented coaching platform built specifically around Gena and her clients, not a generic “for all coaches” tool. The v1 North Star is to give each client a 24/7, always‑available thinking partner that feels like an interactive journal: a place to offload raw, in‑the‑moment thoughts and feelings (emotional relief) and then gently clarify and evolve their thinking (cognitive clarity), without the AI prescribing or impersonating the coach. Clients should experience it as a safe, low‑friction container where they can drop a 2am voice note or text and feel both heard and usefully reflected, while clearly understanding that Gena is not secretly on the other side of the screen—but can see and use what’s valuable later.

On the coach side, the same stream of client–AI interactions is transformed into signal: structured summaries of emotional spikes, recurring themes, contradictions, shifts in narrative, and other patterns that Gena can review before or between sessions. The system supports multiple “spaces”: a private client↔AI channel for journaling and reflection, a private coach↔AI workspace where Gena can see and steer the AI’s evolving mental model of each client (correcting misconceptions, tuning tone, adjusting challenge level), and a shared triad channel (coach↔client↔AI) for occasional joint work when needed. A separate private coach↔client channel can handle human‑only check‑ins and logistics. Permissions and visibility are explicit: clients know what flows through to Gena in what form, and Gena has tools to shape how the AI engages each client without manually reading every raw message.

v1 is intentionally narrow: no generic marketplace, no multi‑coach org features, no billing/scheduling stack—just the core closed loop of client → AI → structured insight → coach → better human sessions → improved AI behavior. The AI’s stance is non‑authoritative and uncertainty‑tolerant (more questions and reflections than “here’s what you should do”), and any more proactive behaviors (like check‑ins or nudges) are treated as a design lever to be added carefully once we’ve validated the basic “clients want to use this on their own” behavior. From Gena’s perspective, this is an operating system to scale her impact per client over time and, later, a foundation she could choose to extend to additional coaches trained in her method. Separate but practical note: some of the earlier files you’d uploaded into this chat have expired—if you want them explicitly in scope as we refine the PRD, re‑upload the latest versions and I’ll fold them in.
